Just a little Node App which tells you the exact spot on the surface of Earth that the ISS is above right now.

ISS location data is taken from 'http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json' which is then reverse geocoded by Mapbox.

If the space station is over the ocean the app reflects that in it's output.
